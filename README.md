## Problem Statement

To build a condition classifier  to define models for associations between data vectors and class labels. 

Project specifics:
* `Dataset used` -  COVID19 sera: 4 classes, 90 patients (1 sample per patient). The groups in this dataset cover cases where patients (i) are healthy, (ii) are symptomatic without COVID19, (iii) have non-severe COVID19 or (iv) have severe-COVID19.
* `Classes considered` - `Covid` and `No-Covid`


## Folder structure
The folder structure is as follows:
* `imputer.py` - MissForest imputer code to fill in missing values in the dataset
